# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I understood the ideas of what needed to be performed it waas mostly the syntax that messed me up. It also helps reading through all of the directions.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? It is going well, I seem to take notes most over each concept.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? Usually I try to solve it myself first and then use my notes, and then follow it up with Google.
